# Smash Up Randomizer — Roadmap

High-level product and engineering priorities. Update this file in the same PR when work **implements, completes, or materially advances** items listed under **Now** or **Next** (see project Cursor rule: full development workflow).

## Vision

- Help Smash Up players set up games quickly with fair randomization and a clear, bilingual (EN/DE), GDPR-respecting experience.

| Area     | Notes                                                                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core app | Laravel 13, Blade, Vite, **Tailwind CSS 4** (dark-first UI), Alpine.js (`sur-*` layout components, scroll-reveal), bilingual frontend strings; modern public header/footer (pill nav, footer columns); custom global scrollbar (indigo/violet “SUR” thumb + zinc track, `.sur-scrollbar` utility); **marketing landing** on `/` (carousels, CTAs, **faction spotlight** hero art — four base factions, original AI — see `docs/image-credits.md`); **shuffle `<dialog>`** wizard (stepper, radio player tiles, sticky footer); **landing marketing enhancements** — stats bar, "How it works" 3-step section, faction combo tiles, faction teaser strip, improved eyebrow copy (EN/DE); **landing phase 3** — FAQ accordion (4 Q&As, EN/DE), result-preview image section, improved OG/Twitter meta, Schema.org WebApplication JSON-LD |
| Branding | SVG logo mark + generated favicons / touch icons; manifest paths under `/images/favicons/` |
| Privacy  | First-party cookie UI (bottom strip + preference modal); web analytics via **self-hosted Matomo** (`analytics.kadsuno.com`) only after opt-in, configurable (see `config/matomo.php`, CHANGELOG) |
| Ops      | Optional **Sentry** error reporting (`sentry/sentry-laravel`, `SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN`, `config/sentry.php`); transactional email via Laravel mailer — **SMTP** (`MAIL_*`) or **Brevo API** (`MAIL_MAILER=brevo`, `BREVO_API_KEY`, same pattern as Issue Forge; see README) |

## Now

- **Faction data pipeline** ✅ — All 106 factions seeded via versioned JSON files + `DeckSeeder` + `factions:import` Artisan command (idempotent). Foundation for full faction pages, filtering, and randomizer enrichment.
- **Faction wiki enrichment** ✅ — `php artisan factions:enrich` fetches all faction fields from the Smash Up Fandom wiki (MediaWiki API), parses wikitext via `WikitextParser`, writes enriched JSON files, and syncs DB. All 13 previously-empty fields now populated per faction.
- **Expansions pages** ✅ — `/expansions` overview + `/expansions/{slug}` detail; browse all officially released sets with faction count and thumbnail preview grid.
- **Faction complexity filter** ✅ — Client-side Alpine filter pills (All / Easy / Medium / Hard) on the `/factions` list page.
- **Quick shuffle `/random`** ✅ — One-click shuffle for 2 players without the wizard.
- **Frontend user authentication** ✅ — Public registration, login, e-mail verification, and password reset. Role-based separation (`admin` / `user`). Foundation for faction collection, shuffle presets, and play history.

## Next

- **Faction collection** — Authenticated users select which expansion sets they own; shuffle uses their personal card pool by default.
- **Shuffle presets** — Save named shuffle configurations (player count + included/excluded factions) to re-use at future game nights.
- **Play history** — Store past shuffle results per user; view recent faction pairings.

## First release readiness
