    'help_smashup_function' => 'Unlike other card deck games, there are predetermined and relatively balanced decks, namely the factions. Each player chooses two factions, which then act together for the entire game (hence the name - derived from "mash up"). For example, you can play as alien wizards or ninja zombies. The 2-4 players try to crack bases that are open on the table in front of them, by attaching to these creatures. In doing so, creatures can be destroyed, moved, returned to hand, etc. with creature abilities, but also with action cards. The goal is to have as many creatures as possible at the time of base scoring. After each base evaluation, victory points are distributed, which ultimately determine the winners. Each faction adds new game mechanics. The appeal of the game is derived from the interaction of these factions.',
